## Welcome to the Saezlab GitHub! 👋

Our goal is to acquire a functional understanding of the deregulation of signalling networks in disease and to apply this knowledge to develop novel therapeutics. We focus on cancer, auto-immune and fibrotic disease. Towards this goal, we integrate big (‘Omics’) data with mechanistic molecular knowledge into statistical and machine learning methods. To this end, we have developed a range of tools in different areas of biomedical research, mainly using the programming languages R and Python.
