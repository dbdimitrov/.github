# Welcome to the github page of [Saez Lab](www.saezlab.org)!

We are   a research group at at the Institute for Computational Biomedicine at the Medical Faculty of Heidelberg University and Heidelberg University Hospital. We develop software tools for systems level analysis and mechanistic modeling of molecular and biomedical data.

Our goal is to acquire a functional understanding of the deregulation of
signalling networks in disease and to apply this knowledge to develop novel
therapeutics. We focus on cancer, auto-immune and fibrotic disease. Towards
this goal, we integrate big (‘omics’) data with mechanistic molecular knowledge
into statistical and machine learning methods. To this end, we have developed
a range of [tools](https://saezlab.org/?#tools) in different areas of biomedical research, mainly using the
programming languages R and Python.

Our major tools are summarized [here](https://saezlab.org/?#tools).
